After recording [an episode of *Retake* about *Rogue One*](https://nightowl.fm/retake/15), TJ and I started talking about where the movie fell within our personal favorites list. I realized I didn’t have my list written somewhere.

Here’s my list that’ll be updated as new movies come out.

1. [*The Last Jedi*][001]
2. [*The Empire Strikes Back*][002]
3. [*The Force Awakens*][003]
4. [*A New Hope*][004]
5. [*Rogue One*][005]
6. [*Return of the Jedi*][006]
7. [*The Rise of Skywalker*][007]
8. [*Revenge of the Sith*][008]
9. [*Solo*][009]
10. [*The Phantom Menace*][010]
11. [*Attack of the Clones*][011]

What about you? I’d love to read your list.
