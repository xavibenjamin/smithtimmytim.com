I love *Star Wars*, [coffee](https://youtu.be/sNlf_SLh_v4), taking pictures, spending time with friends, [reading comics](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/smithtimmytim), writing on my blog, [making YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/smithtimmytim), [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/ttimsmith/), playing board games, and spending time naked near water (except lakes 🤮. Not a huge fan of lakes).

I was born and raised in Southern California. In 2012, I moved to Minnesota and spent seven years there. It was a great adventure. It helped me grow in ways I would've never imagined and lead me to meet my incredible spouse.

I'm an empathetic human, striving to be kind and loving to my fellow humans.

## Work Stuff

I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer at [10up](https://10up.com/).

I'm also the creator of [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pics/). In 2019, I successfully raised over $10k [on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timothybsmith/bokeh-private-independent-and-user-funded-photo-sh/description) to create an initial app. Bokeh is an Instagram alternative to share photos with friends and family privately.

Previously, I was the Senior Producer at [Changelog](https://changelog.com/), Senior UX Designer & Developer at [Mealthy](https://mealthy.com/), Design Mentor at [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/), UX Developer at [Galvanize](https://www.wegalvanize.com/), and Owner of [Anythin' Goes](https://anythingoes.net/). [Relay FM](https://www.relay.fm/), [Carbon Ads](https://carbonads.net/), [&Yet](https://andyet.com/), [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com/), [Crush & Lovely](https://crushlovely.com/), and [The Clinton Foundation](https://www.clintonfoundation.org/) are more of the amazing organizations I've had the chance to work with. Here's [my resume](/files/timsmith-resume.pdf) if you're interested.

## Other Cool Stuff

I hosted The East Wing from 2012–2015. It was a podcast that interviewed people who build the web. The podcast was nominated for a Net Magazine award two years in a row.

I had a blog called Bright Pixels (formerly The Bold Report) that I wrote from 2013–2019. My writing has also appeared on [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/blog/post/organize-that-sass/), [UX Booth](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/consistency-key-to-a-better-user-experience/), and [Net Magazine](https://www.creativebloq.com/how-to/create-a-responsive-layout-with-css-grid).
